# Learning Repository

This repository contains various experiments Iâ€™m conducting while learning web development and programming. Each folder in this repository covers a different topic or tool, ranging from basic HTML to backend development with Python, Flask, and Django.

## What I Am Learning
- **HTML-CSS**  
- **SCSS**  
- **Bootstrap**  
- **PHP**  
- **Node.js**  
- **Jekyll**  
- **Python**  
- **Flask**  
- **Django**  

## Tools Used
- **Visual Studio Code** (VsCode)
- **Live Sass Compiler**  
- **Git & GitHub**  
- **Mozilla Firefox** (for browser testing)
- **Apache & MySQL**  
- **Python**  
- **Flask & Django**  

## Learning Approach
My learning approach relies heavily on my mood. If I feel like learning Python, I focus on Python; if Iâ€™m in the mood for PHP, I work on PHP. My learning can change based on my moodâ€”who knows, maybe someday Iâ€™ll learn cooking too ðŸ˜….
